# Microsquad Client

A mobile client for MicroSquad.

The client integrates a shared game status view (typically an iframe), as well as Microsquad interaction panels to support typical group interactions (display images or texts, participate to votes, read sensor values etc...).

The client uses :
* Vue (PWA)
* Buefy (Bulma UI framework)

The UI can be themed via SASS.
